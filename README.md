# Automated Offensive Comment Filtering
This project is centered on developing a sophisticated system for detecting and filtering offensive comments using advanced machine learning algorithms. Offensive language on online platforms is a pervasive issue that can inflict considerable harm on individuals and communities.

To tackle this problem, the project involves constructing a robust classification model by employing machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision trees. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing comments labeled as offensive or non-offensive, enabling it to accurately predict the nature of new comments based on their content.

The model’s effectiveness is rigorously assessed using critical metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring reliable performance. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning is implemented to optimize the model’s accuracy and responsiveness.

Upon successful training and optimization, the model can be deployed to filter offensive comments in real-time, providing a binary output that determines whether a comment is offensive or not.

In conclusion, "Automated Offensive Comment Filtering" offers a powerful solution for maintaining a respectful and safe online environment by effectively identifying and mitigating harmful content.
